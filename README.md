# Social-Seq Project 🐭

Language 🌐: [**中文**](README_cn.md) | English


Welcome to the Social-Seq project! This is a system for analyzing multi-animal classification, 3D pose reconstruction, social behavior recognition, and social sequence labeling during close animal interactions. Through constructing a real-time closed-loop optogenetic intervention system, this project has potential applications in treating social deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ✨
